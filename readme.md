Things we will learn in this lesson:

    - How to use softmax function for multi-class classifiction
    - learn how to use the inbuilt dataset from torch
    - Build simple neural network using pytorch
    - customize neural network build for single, multiple dimensions and also for multiple output
    - exploring multiple activation function and their drawbacks and solutions
